## Attributions
Thank you to [dtcooper](https://github.com/dtcooper) for making a GitHub repository that allows me to [run Debian Bookworm inside a Docker container.](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspberrypi-os-docker) [dtcooper](https://github.com/dtcooper), I could not have done it without you. Also, to protect my virtual server, thank you to [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) for having a question I really needed the answer to with them. I also appreciate [MilitanteDoPT](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11874474/militantedopt) for asking ["Is there still a Microsoft Authenticator dev API? How can I use It?" on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57767763/is-there-still-a-microsoft-authenticator-dev-api-how-can-i-use-it) because I needed the answer. Turns out, there was code in the [NuGet gallery](nuget.org/packages) to allow me to do this. The package was called [GoogleAuthenticator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoogleAuthenticator) They also had a [GitHub version of this](https://github.com/BrandonPotter/GoogleAuthenticator). To make it even more secure, I decided to add a VPN to it. Thanks to [Free Python Code's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uohPA47TC3w), I was able to find a service called [VPNAPI.io](vpnapi.io) that allows you to integrate a VPN inside a script. There was some [API documentation, too.](https://vpnapi.io/api-documentation) Special thanks to all the services that helped me do this. I really appreciate them! Also, thanks to [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) and [Raspberry Pi](raspberrypi.com) for making this in the first place. It would not have been my favourite decision if it was not for you two!

No. That's all I have.
